# Ranking donors giving history.
## One of the main issues for candidate is call time and asking donors for contributions.

>> This helps analyzing each donors giving history between all other political campaigns and the main candidate campaign. It also checks the value of the donor address with the NYC sales data (If they live in NY) and also the employers. Then ranks these donors and according to their likelyhood to give into a csv file.
